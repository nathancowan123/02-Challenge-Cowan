# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

In this project I used CTRL F to review classes and ID to make sure code was written efficiently. I condensed classes and condensed the css file down 60 or so lines. I added alt tags and organized the site with semantic tags. Then I created a git repo to showcase my work.
